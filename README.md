👋 Hi, I’m Mehrdad

A Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience using data, statistics, and experimentation to support real-world business and product decisions across telecom and healthcare.

I enjoy turning complex datasets into actionable insights using **SQL, Python, and Statistical Analysis**, with a strong focus on **A/B testing, Causal Thinking, and Metric Design**.

I’ve worked on cloud-based analytics and data science solutions across **Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud**, building scalable data models, pipelines, and applied ML systems for prediction and decision support.

My work emphasizes **Practical and Responsible Machine Learning** — prioritizing interpretability, evaluation, and real-world impact over buzzwords.
